      * SECT. XI. No Man comes to command many, unless by Consent or by Force.

      * SECT. XII. The pretended paternal Right is divisible or indivisible: if divisible, 'tis extinguished; if indivisible, universal.

      * SECT. XIII. There was no shadow of a paternal Kingdom amongst the Hebrews, nor precept for it.

    _ CHAP. III.

      * SECT. I. Kings not being fathers of their People, nor excelling all others in Virtue, can have no other just Power than what the Laws give; nor any title to the privileges of the Lord's Anointed.

      * SECT. II. The Kings of Israel and Judah were under a Law not safely to be transgress'd.

      * SECT. III. Samuel did not describe to the Israelites the glory of a free Monarchy; but the Evils the People should suffer, that he might divert them from desiring a King.

      * SECT. IV. No People can be obliged to suffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do.

      * SECT. V. The Mischiefs suffer'd from wicked Kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all Nations that have Virtue and Power to exert both in repelling them.

      * SECT. VI. 'Tis not good for such Nations as will have Kings, to suffer them to be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches.

      * S E C T. VII. When the Israelites asked for such a King as the Nations about them had, they asked for a Tyrant, tho they did not call him so.

      * SECT. VIII. Under the name of Tribute no more is understood than what the Law of each Nation gives to the supreme Magistrate for the defraying of publick Charges; to which the Customs of the Romans, or sufferings of the Jews have no relation.

      * SECT. X. The words of St. Paul enjoying obedience to higher Powers, favour all sorts of Governments no less than Monarchy.

      * SECT. XI. That which is not just, is not Law; and that which is not Law, ought not to be obeyed.

      * SECT. XII. The Right and Power of a Magistrate depends upon his Institution, not upon his Name.

      * SECT. XIII. Laws were made to direct and instruct Magistrates, and, if they will not be directed, to restrain them.

      * SECT. XIV. Laws are not made by Kings, not because they are busied in greater matters than doing Justice, but because Nations will be governed by Rule, and not Arbitrarily.

      * SECT. XV. A general presumption that Kings will govern well, is not a sufficient security to the People.

      * SECT. XVI. The observation of the Laws of Nature is absurdly expected from Tyrants, who set themselves up against all Laws: and he that subjects Kings to no other Law than what is common to Tyrants, destroys their being.

      * SECT. XVII. Kings cannot be the Interpreters of the Oaths they take.

      * SECT. XVIII. The next in blood to deceased Kings cannot generally be said to be Kings till they are crowned.

      * SECT. XIX. The greatest Enemy of a just Magistrate is he who endeavours to invalidate the Contract between him and the People, or to corrupt their Manners.

      * S E C T. XXI. It cannot be for the good of the People that the Magistrate have a power above the Law: and he is not a Magistrate who has not his power by Law.

      * SECT. XXII. The rigour of the Law is to be temper'd by men of known integrity and judgment, and not by the Prince who may be ignorant or vicious.

      * SECT. XXIII. Aristotle proves, that no man is to be entrusted with an absolute Power, by shewing that no one knows how to execute it, but such a man as is not to be found.

      * SECT. XXIV. The power of Augustus Cesar was not given, but usurped.

      * SECT. XXV. The Regal Power was not the first in this Nation; nor necessarily to be continued, tho it had bin the first.

      * SECT. XXVI. Tho the King may be entrusted with the power of chusing Judges, yet that by which they act is from the Law.

      * SECT. XXVII. Magna Charta was not the Original, but a Declaration of the English Liberties. The King's Power is not restrained, but created by that and other Laws; and the Nation that made them can only correct the defects of them.

      * SECT. XXVIII. The English Nation has always bin governed by it self or its Representatives.

      * SECT. XXIX. The King was never Master of the Soil.

      * SECT. XXXI. Free Nations have a right of meeting, when and where they please, unless they deprive themselves of it.

      * SECT. XXXII. The powers of Kings are so various according to the Constitutions of several States, that no consequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one, merely from the name.

      * SECT. XXXIII. The Liberty of a People is the gift of God and Nature.

      * SECT. XXXIV. No Veneration paid, or Honor conferr'd upon a just and lawful Magistrate, can diminish the Liberty of a Nation.

      * SECT. XXXVI. The general revolt of a Nation cannot be called a Rebellion.

      * SECT. XXXVII. The English Government was not ill constituted, the defects more lately observed proceeding from the change of manners, and corruption of the times.

      * SECT. XXXVIII. The Power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in the King. The variety of Customs in chusing Parliament men, and the Errors a people may commit, neither prove that Kings are or ought to be Absolute.

      * SECT. XXXIX. Those Kings only are heads of the People, who are good, wise, and seek to advance no Interest but that of the Publick.

      * SECT. XL. Good Laws prescribe easy and safe Remedies against the Evils proceeding from the vices or infirmities of the Magistrate; and when they fail, they must be supplied.

      * SECT. XLI. The People for whom and by whom the Magistrate is created, can only judg whether he rightly perform his Office or not.
